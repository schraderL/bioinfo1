# Teaching Resources for Bioinformatics 1

## First steps into programming with R
In reality, RNAseq (and all other) analyses are not done in Excel but using programming languages such as R or python. Here, you will get a very first glimpse into the programming language [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). 
As a final part of this bioinformatic practical, you will run a short `R` script to recreate Figure 11 (the MA-plot) and also to plot boxplots for all the genes significantly different (FDR<0.05) between the queens and larvae.


To start, click on the following badge and open an interactive jupyter notebook, which allows you to run R code on a remote server:

<!-- - Launch in RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/schraderL/bioinfo1/master?urlpath=rstudio) -->


Once the server has started, click on the file `Plotting.with.R.ipynb` and follow it.
